- content: "How many clients is Azure HPC Cache designed to support?"

  choices:

    - content: "Tens of clients (10 to 40 clients)"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Caching for 100 clients or less is not the best use case for Azure HPC Cache. The cost benefit is not realized at numbers this small."

    - content: "Hundreds to thousands of clients (100 to 40,000 clients)"

      isCorrect: true

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache is designed to handle requests from up to 40,000 clients."

    - content: "Hundreds of thousands of clients (100,000 to 400,000 clients)"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache would not be able to keep up with requests from over 100,000 clients."

- content: "What protocol is ideal for Azure HPC Cache?"

  choices:

    - content: "NFS"

      isCorrect: true

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache was designed to accelerate NFS requests."

    - content: "SMB"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "SMB is not a supported protocol for Azure HPC Cache."

    - content: "iSCSI"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "iSCSI is not a supported protocol for Azure HPC Cache."

- content: "What is the ideal read/write ratio for Azure HPC Cache?"

  choices:

    - content: "80-100% Read / 0-20% Write"

      isCorrect: true

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache runs optimally when read requests are 80% or more of the traffic."

    - content: "50-80% Read / 20-50% Write"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache is designed primarily as a read cache and does not handle write requests greater than 20%."

    - content: "0-20% Read / 80-100% Write"

      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache is designed primarily as a read cache and does not handle write requests greater than 20%."
